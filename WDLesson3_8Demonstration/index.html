        <h3> Syntax Errors </h3>
        <p> These types are physical mistakes in the way instructions were written such as spelling mistakes, missing or incomplete parentheses, quotations or brackets.<span class="highlight"> These errors stop a program from running</span>
        </p>
        <h3> Runtime Errors </h3>
        <p> As the name implies these errors occur when the program is running but a situation arises that stop the execution of the program such as invalid user input or incorrect calculation that results in an illegal operation.<span class="highlight"> These errors allow the program to run under normal conditions but stop when an illegal operation is encountered.</span>
        <h3> Logical Errors </h3>
        <p> These errors are typically the toughest to fix because they do not stop your program nor produce error messages to the console but still produce the wrong outcome<span class="highlight"> These errors will not stop a program.</span>

        <!-- Note: There are three potential errors in the above code that can be addressed in either the HTML or the JS                    
                   1) Check the id of the text inputs and the div container (Runtime)
                   2) Missing closing quotations in the event handler reference (Syntax)
                   3) Incorrect reference to event handler (Runtime)
                   4) Insufficient text inputs for calculating the average of three numbers (Logical / Runtime)
